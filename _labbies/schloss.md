My interests span the breadth of microbiome research. My work in this field can be divided in to "wet" and "dry" components that are each a result of my interdisciplinary training and drive to look at microbial research questions differently. My interdisciplinary training motivates me to investigate bacteria as members of communities. This community-based approach has yielded recent publications from my laboratory where, instead of trying to link individual bacteria with pathogenesis, we seek to understand how entire microbial communities and subsets of those communities could be used to classify people by their health status or risk of disease. When I started pursuing these questions as a postdoc, we didn't have the necessary computational tools to find the answers. So we made them ourselves. Trained as a biological engineer, I acquired the skills needed to develop several prominent computer programs for analyzing the DNA sequence data generated from microbial ecology experiments. Together, my papers describing these tools have been cited thousands of times. The ability to bridge biology and computational sciences has allowed me to leave a positive impact on a diverse array of important research questions spanning from colon cancer and *Clostridium difficile* infections to the soil and deep sea.
