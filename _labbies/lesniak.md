From age twelve until shortly after I began my career in industrial design, I battled intermittent gastrointestinal complications. While a design engineer for General Motors, I was attempting to understand the pathology of my afflictions when I serendipitously discovered a probiotic able to eliminate my gastrointestinal ailments. This personal probiotic remediation was the impetus to divert my focus from design to microbiology. Based on this experience, I seek to improve our comprehension of the interactions between our resident intestinal microbes and disease. To this aim, the focus of my dissertation project is to elucidate the interaction between the microbiome and Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), the primary health-care associated diarrheal infection.
