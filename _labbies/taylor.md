I am currently studying Microbiology as a major and Applied Statistics as a minor. I work with Sarah Tomkovich investigating the connections between gut motility, the gut microbiome, and infection by Clostridium difficile. I also work with Begüm Topçuoglu in studying the gut microbiome in relation to colorectal cancer. Before graduating, I hope to complete an Honors Thesis.
